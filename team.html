        <p>I earned my B.F.A. in design from Howard University in DC and my M.A. in International Studies from UCLA. After traveling around the world, I settled in greater Seattle five years ago. I'm raising a 12 year old son and a 10 year old tomcat.</p><br>

        <p>I was raised in FlatLand, IL, and I've lived in Washington for six years, having fallen in love with the area as a child.  I volunteer at Woodland Park Zoo and enjoy spending time with my cats.  I read lots of books, and also play video games.  It's all really quite banal.</p><br>

        <p>I'm from Shaw Island and have lived in the Pacific Northwest most of my years. I love to learn; anything from spinning wool to coding. My B.A is in humanities and I love to read and study people, history and the evolution of ideas.</p><br>
